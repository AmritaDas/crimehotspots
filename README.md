# crimehotspots
An analysis of the crime hotspots and trends in Raleigh, NC from 2005-2015


To run the Data analytics code: open "projectAnalysis.R" and run to see results and graphs. 
To run the shiny App developed during the project: open "server.R" and "ui.R" and execute shiny::runApp()

NOTE: It initially takes time to load the graphs the first time the APP is started.

All the graphs generated will be stored in "./ProjectImages/"
